              is a company that has been making people’s lives easier and more
              convenient in the past 4 years. The idea is simple: you order a
              boost via the mobile app and you get high-quality gas at your
              parking spot while you are away. This is the wonderful team of
              engineers who make all this possible:
            </p>

        <div class="row no-padding vertical-align ">
          <div class="col-md-9 ">
            <p>
              In the beginning, we had to make a choice about the DBMS around
              which we would build Booster: we needed flexibility, high
              availability and easy development. All of these were offered by
              MongoDB for free. To make our loyal users happy, we constantly
              improve our applications which sometimes causes changes in our
              data structures. MongoDB handles these situations well and lets
              us focus on different problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              Booster quickly became part of people’s everyday lives in
              Silicon Valley, resulting with rapid growth which has not
              stopped since then.

            Need for PostgreSQL

          <div class="row">
            <p>
              Just like many other companies, we recognized the importance of
              data analysis as we grew. Data analysis helps us increase our
              productivity and make better decisions for the future. We needed
              the ability to perform joins which means that we needed a
              relational system. Our data engineers were mostly familiar with
              SQL and we just needed to pick a RDBMS for our data warehouse.
              <!-- We came across a great data visualisation tool called Periscope. Periscope is flexible and very easy to use.  -->
            </p>
            <p>
              Finding the right RDBMS is not an easy task and there are many
              database vendors to choose from. We wanted to keep our costs as
              low as possible.

                  We chose Postgres since it offered the most important things
                  we were looking for:
                </p>
                <ul>

                  <li>
                    flexible (the JSON support lets us go schema-less whenever
                    we want to)
                  </li>

            Adventures with MoSQL
          </h4>
          <div class="row no-padding vertical-align ">
            <div class="col-md-9">
              <p>
                We used an ETL tool called
                <span class="link">
                  <a href="https://github.com/stripe/mosql">MoSQL</a>
                </span>
                to transfer our data from MongoDB to Postgres. MoSQL was
                created by Stripe and announced in 2013: free, open-source and
                easy-to-use. It transfers all of the collections defined in a
                collection map and syncs with MongoDB for changes. We loved
                MoSQL but unfortunately it is no longer maintained. In 2018 we
                faced multiple issues: MoSQL crashed when there were schema
                changes and connectivity issues. This resulted with
                reimporting millions of documents from the beginning on a
                weekly basis. Before the reimporting has been started, all of
                the tables were dropped by MoSQL, making us
                <b>unable to generate reports and make plans for the next days
                  and weeks</b>
                when necessary. A full reimport took more than 5 hours. As
                time passed, the issues were more and more frequent and we
                were left with error messages which did not describe what went
                wrong. We recognized the need to take things into our own
                hands.

                We needed a service our analytics team could rely on. We
                created Purr to do what MoSQL did right and handle the issues
                MoSQL could not handle anymore. We did not want to make
                drastic changes in our app logic because we wanted the
                trasition to be as smooth as possible. We kept the collection
                map and generated an output similar to the one that MoSQL
                generates. This way we could avoid refactoring most of our SQL
                queries and integrate our solution with a only a few changes.
                We also kept in mind the connectivity issues MoSQL could not
                always handle.

                    We decided to extend Purr with some additional features:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        transfering data to a custom schema
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        generate the schema based on MongoDB collections
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        when restarting, update, drop or trucate the existing
                        tables, create or empty the whole schema etc.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        in case of connectivity issues wait for a while,
                        attempt to reconnect to PostgreSQL or MongoDB and
                        start tailing the oplog again from the timestamp saved
                        in the database
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        update collection map without dropping or stopping
